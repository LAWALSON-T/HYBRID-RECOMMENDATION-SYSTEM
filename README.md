# HYBRID-RECOMMENDATION-SYSTEM
An anime recommendation system using collaborative filtering and content based filtering to create a hybrid recommendation model

Most recommender systems make use of either or both collaborative filtering and content based filtering, more current recommender systems typically combine both or even more techniquesto create a hybrid system.

# TYPES OF RECOMMENDER SYSTEM

•	Collaborative/ User-based filtering: The main idea behind these methods is to use other users’ preferences to recommend new items to a user. The usual procedure is to find similar users to recommend new items which where liked by those users, and which presumably will also be liked by the user being recommended.

•	Content-Based/ Item-based filtering: Content based recommenders will instead use data exclusively about the items. For this we need to have a minimal understanding of the users’ preferences, so that we can then recommend new items with similar tags/keywords to those specified (or inferred) by the user.

•	Hybrid methods: Which, as the name suggests, include techniques combining collaborative filtering, content based and other possible approaches. Nowadays most recommender systems are hybrid, as is the case of factorization machines.

# Cosine similarity

cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two sequences of numbers. For defining it, the sequences are viewed as vectors in an inner product space, and the cosine similarity is defined as the cosine of the angle between them, that is, the dot product of the vectors divided by the product of their lengths. It follows that the cosine similarity does not depend on the magnitudes of the vectors, but only on their angle.

# TFIDF VECTORIZER

The TfidfVectorizer converts a collection of raw documents into a matrix of TF-IDF features. It calculates the frequency of the word with the consideration on how often it occurs in all documents.
